          <p>Hi there! I'm Jared Rand. Welcome to my website.</p>
          <p>I'm a Toronto-based developer and I love to teach and learn.</p>
          <p>
            I've worked as a Teaching Assistant (twice), a Research Assistant
            (once), a Full-Stack Developer, a Front-End Developer (with a
            sprinkling of backend work), and even as a courier!
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm also very active creatively. I love to write, draw, play
            ukulele, and run Dungeons & Dragons games (I even started the
            Dungeons & Dragons club at Ryerson University!) I've written a
            novel, dabbled in stand-up (I've got a video of it somewhere on
            YouTube), and I'm obsessed with finding good music.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="contact-me.html">Reach out to me</a> if you want to know
            more, or even just to chat.
          </p>
          <p>Have fun checking out my website!</p>

          <p>
            Everything on this website was drawn, built, coded, and/or designed
            by me, including the game above and the engine that runs it.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal with this website was to introduce people to who I am and
            showcase some of my skills. I hope this website, and the game above,
            accomplish that, or at least let you have a bit of fun while looking
            me up.
          </p>

              >All of the website code</a
            >
            is available on my
            <a href="https://github.com/wulffhunter">GitHub profile</a>, where I
            will also soon post <a>a generalized version of the game engine</a>.
            I hope these can be useful in the future.
