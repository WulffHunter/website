        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hi there! I'm Jared Rand. Welcome to my website.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm a Torontonian developer who loves to learn and have fun with whichever area I'm working in.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the time of writing this, I'm a full-stack developer at Top Hat Monocle Inc. I'm a graduate of
            Computer Science from Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University).
            I'm a former developer for Setter Inc and Desato Inc, and a former Research Assistant for
            Professor Andriy Miranskyy, where we developed a paper on log analysis via Machine Learning
            presented at the ICSE 2021 Conference, for which we received an NSERC USRA grant. I was also
            a Teaching Assistant for Artificial Intelligence I (CPS721) under Professor Mikhail Soutchanski
            and Web Development I (CPS530) under Professor Maryam Davoudpour at TMU.
            (I've also worked as a courier, though that doesn't have much to do with Computer Science).
        </p>
        <p>
            I co-founded Coterie: Collective Memories (now 
            <a href="https://www.coteriebooks.com">Coterie Books</a>) with Ariel Vinizki and Maryam Pazerandeh,
            and built an initial prototype of the application.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've worked in fields such as app development, web development, DevOps, and team management. At school, 
            I've worked in fields such as Search Engine Development, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Compilers, 
            Database Management, Computer Graphics, and Virtual Reality. I've built projects in my own time in the 
            fields of video games, compilers, and apps. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm also passionate about my creative projects. I like to write, draw, work out, play ukulele, 
            and bartend. I've recently finished writing my third draft of my 90,000-word fantasy novel, and 
            continue to try to hone my skills in areas such as short story writing and comic book illustration. 
            I've completed a course in stand-up comedy at Second City (there is a video of it hidden deep 
            in the bowels of YouTube). I enjoy reading (though it can be hard to do so when Netflix is so close!) 
            and going on tons of extra-long walks. I'm also very passionate about the environment and good music.
