        <h1>Contact Me</h1>
        <p>
            The best way to get in touch with me is to email me at <code>jared &lt;at&gt; jaredrand.com</code> 
            (I've written it like this to prevent web crawlers from inundating my inbox with spam).
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also shoot me a message on 
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jared-rand-522907134/">
                LinkedIn
            </a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            It doesn't have to be about anything in specific. Send me messages, questions, "happy new years", 
            or even music recommendations. It doesn't matter: I'm happy to help!
        </p>
        <p>
            Talk to you soon!
