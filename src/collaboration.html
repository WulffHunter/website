            I'm currently an author on 2 papers:
          </p>
          <ul>

              <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/details/icse-2021/icse-2021-New-Ideas-and-Emerging-Results/14/On-Automatic-Parsing-of-Log-Records">
                <em>
                  On Automatic Parsing of Log Records
                </em>
                for the ICSE NIER 2021 Conference, and;

          <p>
            For the ICSE paper, I worked with
            <a href="https://www.cs.ryerson.ca/~avm/">
              Professor Andriy Miranskyy</a
            >
            to create some Recurrent Neural Network models using Keras and
            TensorFlow to analyze Apache log strings.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the paper for the Journal of Language and Memory, I created both
            the
            <a href="https://github.com/WulffHunter/PREAlgorithm">
              PRE Algorithm</a

            and the

              Rational TE Algorithm</a

            I'm grateful to have been able to co-found
            <a
              href="https://www.coteriebooks.com/"
            >Coterie: Collective Memories Inc.</a>, where I worked as the company's
            initial CTO.
          </p>
          <p>
            I built the initial version of the application using a React + Redux
            frontend and an Express backend, entirely in TypeScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            I helped with the company setup, and located the designer who provided
            Coterie with its fantastic logo.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm incredibly proud of the company's mission and origin, and the fact
            that we paired with sustainable print providers to provide an
            eco-friendly product.
          </p>
          <p>
            In August 2021, I parted ways with Coterie to focus on my responsibilities
            at Top Hat, but I continue to excitedly watch the company's growth and
            am thrilled about the product's launch.

            I built and wrote a shader lab for Toronto Metropolitan University's
            <a
              href="https://www.torontomu.ca/calendar/2020-2021/courses/computer-science/CPS/643/"

              Virtual Reality course</a
            >, in which students learn the fundamentals of Unity's shaders and
            experiment with simple shader examples.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lab has been available to students starting in the Winter 2021
            semester at TMU.

            I've been a part of two fantastic clubs at TMU:
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ARRGamers/">
              the Association of Ryerson Role-players and Gamers (ARRG!)
            </a> and the <a href="https://www.ryersonai.ca">TMU AI team</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            With ARRG!, I helped create the
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ARRGDND/">ARRG D&D group</a>,
            which coordinates regular Dungeons& Dragons games for TMU
            students and pairs players up with Game Masters. I later became the
            Vice-President and President of the club, where we managed to
            recruit over 100 new players.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the TMU AI team, I worked with the Engineering department
            to create a TMU AI mobile app, which is hopefully coming soon!
