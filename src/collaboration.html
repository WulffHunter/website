            I'm currently an author on 2 papers: one for the Journal of Language
            and Memory, and another for the International Conference of Software
            Engineering (ICSE).
          </p>
          <p>
            For the paper for the Journal of Language and Memory, I created both
            the
            <a href="https://github.com/WulffHunter/PREAlgorithm">
              PRE Algorithm</a
            >
            and the
            <a href="https://github.com/WulffHunter/RationalTEAlgorithm">
              Rational TE Algorithm</a
            >
            to analyze transpositional errors in number recall.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the ICSE paper, I worked with
            <a href="https://www.cs.ryerson.ca/~avm/">
              Professor Andriy Miranskyy</a
            >
            to create some Recurrent Neural Network models using Keras and
            TensorFlow to analyze log strings.

            I built and wrote a shader lab for Ryerson's
            <a
              href="https://www.ryerson.ca/calendar/2020-2021/courses/computer-science/CPS/643/"

              Virtual Reality course</a
            >, in which students learn the fundamentals of Unity's shaders and
            experiment with simple shader examples.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lab will be available to students starting in the Winter 2021
            semester at Ryerson.

            I've been a part of two fantastic clubs at Ryerson:
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ARRGamers/">
              the Association of Ryerson Role-players and Gamers (ARRG!)
            </a> and the <a href="https://www.ryersonai.ca">Ryerson AI team</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            With ARRG!, I helped create the
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ARRGDND/">ARRG D&D group</a>,
            which coordinates regular Dungeons& Dragons games for Ryerson
            students and pairs players up with Game Masters. I later became the
            Vice-President and President of the club, where we managed to
            recruit over 100 new players.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the Ryerson AI team, I worked with the Engineering department
            to create a Ryerson AI mobile app, which is hopefully coming soon!
