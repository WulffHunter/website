                <p>
                    I'm very active in design and creating art!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've created designs for personal projects, comic books, backgrounds, school, 
                    and even some of the companies I've worked at, <a href="http://www.desato.com">
                        Desato Inc.
                    </a> and <a href="https://setter.com">
                        Setter Inc.
                    </a>.
                </p>

                </p>

        <div id="writing" class="section">
            <div class="section-info">
                <p>
                    In addition to art, I've been writing since I was a child.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some projects I've done include <em>Wulff Hunter: The Wolf's Whisper</em>, a +80,000-word 
                    fantasy novel, several comic book scripts, short stories, songs, and some poetry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My writing also comes in handy for documentation! At Setter, I wrote several important 
                    documents including in-depth bug postmortems and tutorials for developers. Practicing 
                    my writing helped me create documentation that was easier to understand and more 
                    enjoyable to read.
