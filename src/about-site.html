        <h1>About This Site</h1>
        <h2>What's up with the game?</h2>
        <p>
            Ever since I first got into Computer Science, I've wanted to make a website with a minigame 
            on it, so people knew where to find me and could have fun while doing it. I wanted to create 
            something simple to play but complex enough to showcase my skills and feels good to play. 
            And now, here we are!
        </p>
        <h2>How do I play it?</h2>
        <p>
            Click anywhere to make the main character come to your cursor. Fiends will appear all over the 
            screen. To attack them, approach them and click near the character to swing your sword. Make 
            sure you're standing underneath them: you don't want to be slashing at the air behind them!
        </p>
        <p>
            And no, you can't die. Why should I punish someone for playing on my website?
        </p>
        <h2>How did you build it?</h2>
        <p>
            Since this game was supposed to be a showcase of my skills, I opted to build the entire thing 
            with just HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some art I drew in Pixen (with the help of Webpack to 
            bundle it all together). I created my own engine, inspired by Game Maker and the Amethyst 
            Engine built in Rust. While my own engine went through a few iterations, I ended up creating 
            a solution that used objects rather than an Entity-Component System for speed.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've posted the source code to the website <a>here</a>. I'm also working on a more generalized 
            version of the engine <a>here</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Who's that little guy?</h2>
        <p>
            I'm glad you asked! His name is Wulff Hunter, and he's both my online avatar and my character 
            creation. I've written several short stories and one novel (so far) about him. He's a cool guy.
        </p>
        <p>
            As for the Fiends, they're a monster I created for a video game I've been working on for 
            a few years. I used them because I think their animation is nice and smooth.
        </p>
        <h2>What did you use to create the site in general?</h2>
        <p>
            As stated above, all I used was HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Webpack to bundle it together. I 
            opted not to use anything else to keep the page as much my own code as possible. Besides, 
            not every website needs React!
